## Research
The ON-OFF switch of genes is critical for cell fate decision, development and human disease. 
Our group will combine single cell genomics and cutting-edge microscopy technology to identify
what genes are turned on or off in cell type-specific or disease-specific manners.
How are these genes precisely controlled in space and time?
We will use CRISPR-based live cell DNA and RNA tracing system to understand the spatiotemporal regulation of genes during the physiological process,
and we will harness CRISPR-based editing technology to reverse aberrant gene expression in the disease models.
