Published codes, scripts from Hanhui Ma's Lab

## About Us
Our lab located at ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. 

We foucus on Chromatin biology and CRISPR applications. This Github page stores our code, scripts. Hope they help you!

## Research
The ON-OFF switch of genes is critical for cell fate decision, development and human disease. 
Our group will combine single cell genomics and cutting-edge microscopy technology to identify
what genes are turned on or off in cell type-specific or disease-specific manners.
How are these genes precisely controlled in space and time?
We will use CRISPR-based live cell DNA and RNA tracing system to understand the spatiotemporal regulation of genes during the physiological process,
and we will harness CRISPR-based editing technology to reverse aberrant gene expression in the disease models.

## Code
Our works are easy to reproduce! All our sofwares are on the concept that sofware should be easy to use, be used by every ordinary people who know nothing about coding. Feel free to use them.
